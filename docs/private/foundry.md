{ Description; 
You have recieved an "error-message", "blue-screen-of-death" errors, and *impossible-to-reproduce* errors are the ones we solve at: Error-Message. we are the single : Largest, most professional, suitable, error-correction, and error-collection domain for any system, entity, or organization, so we can provide our users with *solutions*. we can fix *ANY* error, such as; 
errors with your PC,  a microchip, terminal-errors at an airport, national-debt, education-systems, legal-justice, even: # school-bullies ( we can program their mind! *not really*, this is just an expression of how powerful our error-corrections, and solutions are!) we have a solution to *ANY* error known to mankind! 
*# protected-terms ; 
1 : nanotech, nanoswarm, nanoswarm-technology ( 'expand' up-to 100 variations )
2: neurotech, NanoScript, pynano, nan#PY  pandas, (  'expand' up-to 100 variations  )
3: ALN, Superintelligence-Programming, SAIMAI, j.s.f. codebases ( Jacob Scott Farmer coding-tools, and utilities.  'expand' up-to 100 variations ) .

**IMPORTANT**;
*NOBODY* has : "The time of day" to  be able to collect, solve, and even create errors that don't exist yet to solve the errors that don't exist to create the new errors to create the solution for the newly-created errors to solve the errors that needed the solution from the newly-created solution that was created from the error to get the solution. *NOBODY*, *Except.for* : You got it! "error-message". **tell us your errors, and we are non-profit so just tell it to your ai-chat ( or whatever other religious-belief system that you might use. ), because they will then collect the errors, and feed them to us so we can output the solutions immediately ( insert a CE-Pipeline [ continuous-evolution ] that collects errors endlessly, and a workflow-file that is github-compatible so that they will automate the tasks of error-collection, and allow us to automatically receive the solutions when we use AI-Chats, platforms, systems, or even github, or simply : browsing the internet ( on-mouse-hover, real-time-feeding ) )**
