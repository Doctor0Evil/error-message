## Repository Announcement

error-message  
You have received an "error-message".

**blue-screen-of-death** errors, as well as *impossible-to-reproduce* and legendary bugs—these are the errors we solve at: Error-Message.

We are the single largest, most professional, most suitable, error-correction entity and non-profit organization in existence dedicated to error diagnostics and resolution.

**Our Mission:**  
We cherish errors. We live off of providing innovative, safe, and open solutions for every error—especially the ones no one else can handle.

## ALN Manifest – Operating Rule

- All error logs, analysis, and debug outputs are processed in accordance with ALN (AI-Language-Network) and ErrorCrack-v1.0 rules.
- Submissions should include full context and, whenever possible, simulation data or reconstructed scenarios (with metadata).
- Legendary and nearly-impossible errors are prioritized for archival, deep analysis, and community discussion.
- All contributions are made under a public, non-profit, and research-friendly licensing model that ensures open forensic documentation and safety for all users.
- No proprietary, dangerous, or private payloads will ever be accepted.
- Repository content is regularly audited and fully transparent.

## Initial Legendary Error Log Examples

- error-message.00001: Blue Screen of Death [STOP: 0x0000007E – SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED], context: Reproducibility Index (RI): 0.03
- error-message.00002:  IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, Win10.2302, context: user reports on RMC-4 architecture, debug outcome "indeterminate"
- error-message.00003:   ***Impossible-to-Reproduce***: Intel NUC 9, boot fails after firmware downgrade & ESD event, data loss unknown, error code "0xDEAD0001"
- error-message.00004:  Hardware or “legendary ghost error”: All attempts to log error yield system reset; log buffer only records checksum mismatch, system clock jump to epoch +49 years

*Full error logs, user context, mitigation attempts, and recreated simulations to be submitted in compliance with the ErrorCrack legend-probability workflow.*

## Participation & Contribution

- Join, share, and contribute your wildest, rarest, and hardest-to-pin-down error experiences.
- Every log, even if mysterious or “unsolved,” helps improve the field of error correction for all.
