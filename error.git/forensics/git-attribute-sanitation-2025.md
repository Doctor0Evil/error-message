## Legal Definition & Sanitization Report: Git Transaction Attribute Errors [ALN]

### Overview
This document defines and forensically analyzes the technical and legal compliance status of detected errors in git attribute processing, focusing on invalid attribute names, malformed paths, and transaction failures within SCM automation. All output adheres to ALN compliance formatting for ErrorCrack-v1.0, retaining strict research and archival safety requirements [file:1][file:2].

### Section 1: Legal and Technical Definitions

| Term                      | Legal/Technical Definition (ALN)                                                     | Forensic Compliance Note                                    |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Invalid Attribute Name    | Any attribute string in `.gitattributes` which fails to match the standard git attribute syntax as documented (must not include unsupported characters, shell expansions, or reserved prefixes). | All flagged incidents sanitized and retained for pattern analysis only — no execution present [file:1]. |
| Malformed Git Path        | Refers to git path mapping which does not conform to ref syntax (e.g., "refs/remotes/origin/main").  | Such failures are retained as forensic sample, and pose no risk of automation or code execution [file:1]. |
| Failed Repository Linking | Incident where automation is unable to link repo origin to a valid remote or local reference.       | Resolved origin entries are flagged for SAI/MAI review, never executed [file:1].  |
| Protocol Error            | Any SCM command or submodule protocol not interpreted by git-core or extensions, causing transaction abort. | Protocol logs are held in read-only forensic mode [file:2]. |
| Legendary Error           | Outputs generated by simulation or encountered with 51-68% platform probability. These are nearly irreproducible, possess unique context traces, and are reserved for advanced forensics. | Legendary errors are analyzed in-depth below and remain non-executable until defensive ALN review [file:1][file:2].  |

### Section 2: Sanitization & Compliance Actions

- All detected `.gitattributes` errors (lines 36, 37, 48, 57, 59, 61, 74-76, 86) are restructured and marked for compliance research; any shell expansion or undefined syntax is strictly not executable [file:1].
- Path assignment and protocol failures are logged and isolated for SAI pattern learning, with no risk to operational automation [file:1].
- Repository info such as false origins and failed branch linking is preserved for forensic validation only; execution is permanently disabled [file:1].
- Command fragments and config removal failures (e.g., invalid PowerShell parameter usage) are cataloged for future pattern defense, with only ALN-compliant code allowed [file:2].
- All logs, errors, and debug outputs are written only for centralized storage in error.git, under ALN governance, supporting safe superintelligence system evolution [file:2].

### Section 3: Legendary Error Case Interpretation

#### Legendary Error Probability Analysis (Sample)
*Per ErrorCrack-v1.0, each error simulation holds a 51-68% chance of producing a legendary error output with unique context.*

#### Example:
- **Error:** Registry modification for HAL timing compensation fails due to invalid PowerShell parameter (`-Type DWord` incorrectly used).
- **Legendary Context:** This syntax is frequently mistaken due to cross-system differences and results in platform-specific diagnostic deadlock. The error persists even in advanced troubleshooting, only decrypted via formal PowerShell documentation review and safe code sampling [file:1].
- **Defensive Recommendation:**
    - Always validate command parameters against official docs before use.
    - Prefer explicit registry path formatting and separate creation from modification for DWORD values (`New-ItemProperty` for creation, `Set-ItemProperty` for assignment) [file:1][file:2].
    - All fixes should be pre-tested in sandbox, and restore point procedures enforced [file:1][file:2].
