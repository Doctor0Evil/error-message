# Error-Message: Universal Error Correction Ecosystem

## Overview

Error-Message is the leading domain for collecting, correcting, and solving virtually any imaginable error—ranging from PC and microchip faults, blue-screen-of-death events, and organizational system failures to national infrastructure challenges and educational mishaps. Powered by the ALN (Alien-Language-Network) framework, advanced agent workflows, and continuous-evolution (CE) pipelines, this repository offers scalable solutions for every system, platform, and sector. If you’ve encountered a legendary, hard-to-diagnose, or impossible-to-reproduce error—this is your solution domain.[3][1]
